## Overview

This lab explores a web application vulnerability that allowed remote command execution (RCE) within the context of the web server. The objective was not privilege escalation, but understanding execution scope, user context, and realistic impact under least-privilege conditions.

## Environment & Context

- Target: Vulnerable web application
- Execution context: Linux-based web server
- Service account: `www-data`
- Access level: Application-layer execution only

## Vulnerability Summary

The application accepted uploaded content without proper validation, enabling server-side execution of arbitrary input. Successful interaction confirmed that commands were executed by the web server process rather than an authenticated system user.

## Execution Confirmation & User Context

Command execution was confirmed within the application context. The process identity was identified as the `www-data` service account, indicating that the vulnerability operated under standard web server permissions rather than elevated privileges.

## Filesystem Observations

The execution environment appeared limited to a web-accessible directory containing both server-side scripts (e.g., PHP files) and static assets (e.g., image files). This strongly suggests interaction within the web root or a served subdirectory rather than broader filesystem access.

## Scope & Impact Assessment

While remote code execution was confirmed, the impact was constrained by:

- Execution under a low-privilege service account (`www-data`)
- Filesystem segmentation limiting access to application directories
- No observed privilege escalation or lateral movement

This indicates an application-layer compromise with limited system-wide impact.

## Detection & Defensive Considerations

From a defensive perspective, this activity could be detected through:

- Web server access logs showing abnormal request patterns
- Application logs indicating unexpected file uploads or execution paths
- File integrity monitoring within web directories
- Alerts on command execution originating from web services

- ## Lessons Learned

This lab reinforced the importance of contextual analysis over assumption-based exploration. The presence of a vulnerability does not inherently imply full system compromise, and understanding execution context, user privileges, and directory roles is critical for accurate impact assessment.

Additionally, recognizing backend indicators such as PHP files and service accounts earlier can significantly accelerate environmental understanding.
