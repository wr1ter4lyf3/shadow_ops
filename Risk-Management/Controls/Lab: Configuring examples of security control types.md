# Configuring Examples of Security Control Types

### Objective
This lab reinforced the ability to identify, implement, and differentiate between **security control categories** and **functional control types** — a foundational concept for both CompTIA Security+ and real-world risk management.

### Lab Overview
The exercise focused on configuring and verifying controls across Windows systems to understand how **preventive**, **detective**, **directive**, **corrective**, and **compensating** measures work in tandem.  

Key verification tasks included:
- Assigning and auditing file access permissions on SMB shares  
- Detecting unauthorized deletions and changes via event logs (Event ID 4663)  
- Using hashing commands (`Get-FileHash`) to verify file integrity  
- Reviewing PowerShell scripts (`calchash.ps1`, `check.ps1`) for proper syntax and execution context  
- Observing how **preventive controls** (like file permissions) and **detective controls** (like audit logs) complement one another

### Key Takeaways
- **Functional Control Mnemonic:** `D2P2C`  
  - **Directive** – Give instructions or enforce acceptable behavior  
  - **Deterrent** – Discourage unwanted behavior  
  - **Preventive** – Stop threats before they occur  
  - **Detective** – Identify or record events after they occur  
  - **Corrective / Compensating** – Restore or mitigate impact after detection  

- **Control Categories (POTM):**  
  - **Physical:** Tangible safeguards (locks, cameras, motion sensors)  
  - **Operational:** Actions taken by people — implementing or following policies  
  - **Technical:** Configurations in software or hardware (firewalls, ACLs, encryption)  
  - **Managerial:** Oversight, policy creation, risk assessment  

- **Common Combinations:**  
  - Motion detectors → *Detective + Deterrent*, *Physical*  
  - Firewall rules → *Compensating + Preventive*, *Technical*  
  - Security awareness training → *Directive + Preventive*, *Operational*

### Reflection
Before this lab, I associated “operational controls” with *business operations*, not the *human element of security enforcement*.  
Seeing them applied clarified that operational = people implementing security, not organizational logistics.  

I also began documenting my shorthand system (link forthcoming: **Kanji Shorthand for Logbooks**) to translate dense, acronym-heavy cybersecurity terms into compact, visual cues for easier recall.  
For example, I write “Fxnal D2P2C / POTM” as a compact reminder of both control types and categories.

This approach is helping me move from **memorizing** security control definitions to **contextualizing** them — understanding how each type functions within a layered defense strategy.
