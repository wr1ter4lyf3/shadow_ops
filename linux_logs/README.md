# Linux Logs

This is where I log what I’m learning through my Intro to Linux training.  
Nothing fancy—just what I’ve used, practiced, or want to remember.

## Quick Index
- Common commands I use daily
- Flags that confuse me but I’m working on
- Shell scripts (eventually!)
- Weird bugs I’ve fixed
