This is not a portfolio.  
This is a log of what I’ve survived, studied, and built with my own hands.  
Here you’ll find:

- Personal projects and technical labs
- Study notes and walkthroughs
- Scripts and commands that helped me troubleshoot real problems
- Moments of clarity in between the chaos

I’m not here to prove anything. I’m here to build what works.
